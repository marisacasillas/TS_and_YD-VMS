# Data and scripts:

Bram Peute & Marisa Casillas (2022). (Non-)effects of linguistic environment on early stable consonant production: A cross cultural case study. _Glossa: A journal of general linguistics 7_(1). [paper link](https://www.glossa-journal.org/article/id/5813/)

This directory contains the scripts used to generate the analyses in the above-cited paper. Access to the raw input data (.eaf files) can be achieved via accessing the Casillas HomeBank repositoryâ€”the raw .eaf files are not shared in this public GitHub repository because the transcribed data may contain identifying information.

Please note that two data tables (`all.reliability.data.csv` and `all.vocalizations.csv`) are not contained in this directory because they have copies of the transcribed vocalizations which, again, may contain identifying information. But with the raw data, these tables can be re-generated using the scripts herein.

Please contact Marisa Casillas (middycasillas@gmail.com) with any issues or inquiries regarding this data. Thank you!
